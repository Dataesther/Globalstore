## RAW DATA/ UNCLEAN DATASETS
After transforming and loading the datasets into power bi, The raw data such as errors, null, missing values ,inconsistencies, and the need for cleaning to make it usable for analysis.Literally without cleaning the datasets will be useless and it will not give the specfic figures or values we are looking for.

## CLEAN DATASETS
When i talk about clean data ,i mean data that has been processed and prepared to be accurate ,consistent , and free of errors ,nulls. cleaning data involves tasks like removing duplicates,handling, missing values,correcting error and standardizing formats. By cleaning the data , i make sure that it is in a suitable condition for analysis ,visualization,and reporting.
